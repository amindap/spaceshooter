Group Evaluation

Cody was really great. His original role was to just create the main menu of the project, 
but when he finished he went on to modify the game making it more dynamic. 
He included shields and helped Triston with the assets he was adding.



Triston did great as well. He modified the enemies appearance and the appearance of the player.
It was obvious that he put a lot into these modifications.
